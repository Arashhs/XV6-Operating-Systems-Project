# Modified XV6 by adding system calls and implementing different scheduling policies for my OS course
- Implemented a modified version of Xv6's original scheduling algorithm and a modified
priority-based scheduling algorithm to take both the waiting time and importance of a task
into account
- Added system calls to choose the scheduling algorithm in a process, to count the number of
called system calls in a process, and several more features
- Added the ability to measure creation time, termination time, sleeping time, ready time, and
running time of processes to evaluate the performance of the new scheduling algorithms
